Ink Canvas Better is a WPF-based screen annotation software that offers support for both `WPS ` and `Microsoft Office`.

## FQA

### The software crashes as soon as I advance to the next slide during a PPT slideshow?
This is likely caused by `Microsoft Office` not being activated. Please activate it yourself.  

### The software doesn't switch to PPT mode when I start the PPT slideshow?
If you previously had `WPS Office` installed and this issue appeared after uninstalling it, it may be due to an unresolved conflict. Try reinstalling WPS as a potential solution.  
Additionally, please note that PowerPoint files in protected (read-only) mode will not be recognized.  

### The application won't launch after installation?
Please verify that you have the `.Net 8.0 runtime` or a newer version installed on your computer. If not, please download it from the [official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime)  

### Where should I submit feature requests and bug reports?

We welcome constructive feedback and reasonable suggestions for new features. The developer will review and address them as time permits. Please be aware that this is a non-commercial project, and developer resources are limited. We appreciate your patience and ask that you refrain from pressing for updates.
